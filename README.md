Predicting PMGSY Road Project Completion and Risk Using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project is an academic end-to-end Machine Learning application that uses Predictive Analytics to analyze PMGSY (Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana) road project data. The objective is to predict road completion levels and identify projects that are at risk of delay using Python-based machine learning techniques.


🎯 Problem Statement

PMGSY road projects often face delays and inefficient utilization of funds. Traditional reporting systems mainly describe past performance and do not provide future predictions. This project aims to solve this issue by building machine learning models that can forecast project completion and classify project risk in advance.

✅ Objectives

Perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis

Predict completed road length using regression models

Classify projects as successful or risky

Identify performance-based project groups using clustering

Validate model performance using standard ML metrics

Build a complete ML workflow strictly within academic syllabus

🗂️ Dataset

The dataset contains PMGSY road project information, including:

State and district details

Scheme type

Sanctioned and completed road length

Sanctioned cost and expenditure

Bridge details

Derived features such as completion percentage and project status were created during preprocessing.
